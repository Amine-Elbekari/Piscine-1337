Dash is fairly well compatible with bash, being based on the same POSIX standard. However, it doesn’t implement the bash-specific extensions. POSIX standard is Portable Operating System Interface, an attempt to standardize UNIX-like OSes. Even though Ubuntu’s system shell is pointing to dash, your login shell as a user continues to be bash at this time.
/bin/bash is the most common shell used as default shell for user login of the linux system. The shell’s name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell. Bash can execute the vast majority of scripts and thus is widely used because it has more features, is well developed and better syntax.
